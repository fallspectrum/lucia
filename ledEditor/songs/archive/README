Effect - A operation to preform on a LED. 
	
Effect Group: A container that holds one or more effects. The effect group  tied to a certain time. Any led's not updated in the current effect group will continue to use the lest effect.

short: A 2 byte value. When the data is saved keep in mind the lowest byte
       comes first. Ex, A short value of 10 in hex would be 0x000A. When it is 
       saved however it's stored as two bytes: 0x0A,0x00

char: A 1 byte value

Controlling the leds:
	Inside the folder there is a file called "song_instructions.h". The char array song_instructions holds a list of bytes that represents one or more effect groups. The last byte of this array has to be 0x00 to signify the end of the song has been reached.

    
Below describes the data that represents a effect group:

    0xff                        - Effect Group Start Byte
    short dt                    - Time to start effect. Relative from the start
                                  of the last event. In steps of 10ms
    [one or more effects]       - One or more effects encoded
    0xff                        - Effect Group End Byte

Below describes how a effect is encoded:
char ledNumber  -Led number, 0 is the first, 1 is the second...
short data[]    -Array of effect data. This is dependent on the effect.
                 See the table below.
 

Available Effects:
-Note all color values can range from 0 to 4095 in decimal (0x00 to 0x0fff in hex)

Here is an example of a effect group triggering 100ms from the last one. Led 0 will blink blue and led 1 will fade from red to blue:

0xff, // Start packet
0x0A, 0x00, //Start 100 ms from last effect
0x00, 0x02, //Led 0, Blink (effect number 2)
0x00, 0x00, // Red is 0
0x00, 0x00, // Green is 0
0xff, 0x00, // Blue is 255
0x01, 0x04, // Led 1, fade between colors (effect number 4)
0xff, 0x00, // Begin Red is 255
0x00, 0x00, // Begin Green is 0 
0x00, 0x00, // Begin Blue is 0
0x00, 0x00, // End Red is 0
0x00, 0x00, // End Green is 0,
0xff, 0x00, //end Blue is 255
0xff, //End packet
0x00, //End of data byte

Here is another example of having the LED 1 blink green at 1 second. Remember, since LED 0 is not set then the last effect for this LED will continue. 

0xff, // Start packet
0x64, 0x00, //Start 1000 ms from last effect
0x01, 0x02, //Led 1, Blink (effect number 2)
0x00, 0x00, // Red is 0
0xff, 0x00, // Green is 255
0x00, 0x00, // Blue is 0
0xff, End Packet
0x00, //End of Song byte.
